# Reddit flair detection

Hello, I am Himanshu Garg, a B. tech undergrad @ IIIT-D, majors in CSE.

Here, i am presenting a simple website which can take URL of any submission of Reddit/India and
suggest us the best suited Flair for the post using NLP. The website has been hosted on heroku for ease of use.

URL of the website - https://flairofreddit.herokuapp.com

# HOW to use ?

Website main page looks something like the below image.

<img width="1440" alt="home page of the website" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43913398/61592756-fc9c9180-abf4-11e9-8090-03d457c58d94.png">
